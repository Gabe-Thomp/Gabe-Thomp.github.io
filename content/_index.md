        I've spent time at my home, undergraduate institution (NC State) researching privacy-preserving machine learning. In particular, I applied the neural tangent kernel, typically an analysis tool for neural networks, as a method of updating model weights in the decentralized federated setting. 

        I have also been fortunate to work at MIT as a research intern with the CLEAR Lab. Specifically, I worked on improving the ability of LLMs to ask informative questions by using Bayesian signal to fine-tune models.
