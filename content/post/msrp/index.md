I had the opportunity to participate in the 2025 MIT Summer Research Program! I am so grateful to the coordinators of the program for all the work that they put in to make the experience so amazing. I was surrounded by so many great people from all across the country who all *really cared about science*. It was really fantastic and I couldn't have asked for much more.

In terms of the work, the project focused on teaching LLMs to ask informative questions in the context of preference elicitation. In particular, we wanted to see if the language model could learn to ask better questions by training on a Bayesian-optimal assistant. From here, we were curious whether the model would take these Bayesian skills and generalize outside of the tractable domain in which it was trained. Some preliminary results are shown on the poster above, and we are working towards a manuscript.
