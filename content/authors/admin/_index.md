  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a current undergraduate student at NC State majoring in physics and electrical engineering. During my time here, I have worked under the guidance of Dr. Chau-Wai Wong in federated learning. I am generally interested in 1) intelligent design of AI models and 2) what we can learn about intelligence by studying AI models. Along these lines, I believe that greater adoption of this technology in our society comes with responsibility to ensure robustness and safety. In this vein, research dealing with interpretability seems to be very important.

Apart from work, I love exercise, playing music, and serving the community. I ran my first marathon at a 3:28 time. At NC State, I lead an organization called Music Empowerment, which provides free music lessons to underprivileged kids in the Raleigh area.
